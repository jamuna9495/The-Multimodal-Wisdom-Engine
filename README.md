​🚀 PulsePoint AI: The Multimodal Wisdom Engine
​PulsePoint AI is an intelligent content processing pipeline that transforms hours of long-form video (lectures, podcasts, workshops) into high-impact, 60-second "Bytes" of wisdom. By combining Acoustic Intelligence with GenAI Semantic Reasoning, we automate the bridge between deep education and the modern Attention Economy.
​🌟 Core Features
​Acoustic Peak Detection: Uses Signal Processing to find moments of high emotional energy or audience engagement.
​Semantic Wisdom Filtering: Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash to verify if a "loud" moment actually contains a "Golden Nugget" of information.
​Auto-Reframing (9:16): (Optional/Planned) Computer Vision to track the speaker and crop horizontal video to vertical.
​Dynamic Captioning: Timed, high-contrast overlays to increase viewer retention.
​🏗️ Technical Architecture
​Our system follows a Decoupled Processing Model to ensure high-speed performance without crashing on heavy 4K files.
